- 👋 Hi, I’m @NischhalS,   
- 👀 I’m interested in the evolution of software products happening in this magical world of software development
- 🌱 Currently exploring the depths of Flutter and Dart as a very beginner and trying to create some useful developer tools to automate repeated code done by the Flutter developer in their most of the projects
- 💞️ I’m looking for some collaboraters for a very passionate project, in which I want to develop a Cli tool that can setup flavors, CI/CD pipelines, and Commonly used Utility classes such as NavigationUtils, ApiController with a single command in flutter projects.
